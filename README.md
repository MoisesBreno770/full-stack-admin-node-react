Project with the intention of further strengthening my knowledge in creating API using NodeJS, Express and MongoDB with consumption in React.

## Project execution
To run the project is very simple, first make sure you have node installed. After that, follow these steps:
- Open the terminal inside the 'server' folder and run the command 'npm install' or 'yarn add' (if you are using yarn as manager) to install all the dependencies and then run 'npm run dev'. Make sure that port 5001 is open.
- Having done the above step by step, open the terminal inside the 'client' and also run the command 'npm install' or 'yarn add' (if you are using yarn as manager) to install all the dependencies and then run 'npm start '. Make sure port 3000 is enabled.
- Open http://localhost:3000 to view the project in the browser.
